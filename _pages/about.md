Hey there!

I'm r00ta, also known as Jacopo Rota in the real world. I don't know how you landed here, but hey, welcome!

I was born nearby Milan,

I grew up nearby Milan,

I took my Master's in Computer Science guess where, in Milan,

I still live nearby Milan and I don't plan to move away,

That place nearby Milan is called Saronno.

I'm lucky enough not to live in Milan though :)

When I was at the University I had two main passions: cyber security and machine learning - in particular the so called statistical learning. I used to play CTF (Capture the Flag) contests with <a href='https://l4ser.github.io/'>Fuffateam</a>, you can find some write ups in <a href='https://github.com/r00ta/myWriteUps'>this repo</a>.

In the past I founded a startup, I worked for <a href="https://www.swissre.com/">Swiss RE</a> to build a while label product for the telematics insurance market worldwide and for <a href="https://www.redhat.com/it">Red Hat</a> for its cloud offering.

I then joined <a href="https://canonical.com/">Canonical</a> to work on <a href="https://maas.io/">MAAS</a> because I love low level stuff and hardware hell yeah.

When I'm not sitting at my desk or enjoying life with my family, I'm probably cycling, running or hiking.
